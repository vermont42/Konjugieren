# Dedication

This app is dedicated to my grandfather, **Cliff Schmiesing**.

Cliff was born on March 14, 1904, in Minster, Ohio, a town where German was the language of daily life. All four of his grandparents had immigrated from Germany, and he grew up steeped in that heritage—attending public schools taught by German-speaking nuns from Germany. He went on to study at St. Louis University, where he completed both college and medical school, specializing in obstetrics.

In St. Louis, Cliff met **Grace Ryan**, and they married and had six children together, including Ryan, my mother. The family settled in Salamanca, New York, where Cliff practiced family medicine and delivered babies. In 1938, he joined the Army Reserve to supplement his income. When America entered World War II, the family moved to Fort Jackson in Columbia, South Carolina in January 1942. That December, Cliff was deployed to Oran, Algeria, during the American occupation.

In Oran, Cliff treated soldiers wounded in Southern Italy, Sicily, and North Africa—and delivered most of the babies born in the city in 1943. He died there on January 21, 1944. My mother was just fourteen months old.

Though Ryan never truly knew her father, Cliff's love for his family has echoed through the generations. I feel it today. **Konjugieren** is a tribute to Cliff and to the language he and his ancestors spoke—German.
